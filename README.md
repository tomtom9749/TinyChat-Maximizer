## TinyChat Maximizer
> Adds "maximize" button next to the tinychat.com logo while in a room. Clicking this button should remove unneeded components and maximize the room to fit the browser window.  
> TinyChat Maximizer is a greasemonkey script, so that means you need an extension installed for your browser that can use these scripts.

> There are two versions of TinyChat Maximizer, one that will maximize when the page loads, leaving you with only the chat on the page and manual version that will only work when you press the maximize button.
